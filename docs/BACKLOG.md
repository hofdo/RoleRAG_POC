## In progress — B tier (loop: feat/b-tier)

Order: value + independence, decisions last. Each item gate-verified
(`ruff && mypy && pytest && regression_runner && smoke-run`) and committed before the next.

- [x] **#17** critic error → fail closed (CONTROLLED_FAILURE) instead of serving unvalidated text
- [~] **#9** ~~memory-extraction cloud retry~~ — **DROPPED**: conflicts with the deliberate
  `memory_extraction_stays_local` / `critic_stays_local` invariant; deterministic fallback already covers it
- [x] **#16** auto-ingest scenario lore on `start-session` (CLI; graceful + `--skip-lore-ingest`;
  API create_session left as a follow-up)
- [~] **#19** structured `TurnResult.errors` — **DEFERRED to decision-batch**: `warnings: list[str]`
  spans 78 sites + 4 API schemas + persistence; contract-breaking + taxonomy decision; YAGNI for a
  single-user POC until a UI consumer needs it
- [x] **#15** web/SSE robustness tests + client malformed-frame hardening (404/MIME/traversal;
  parseFrame → ApiError; mid-retrieval already covered)
- [x] **#22** web `/play` retrieval-inspection modal (current turn; query + selected/rejected +
  scores + boosts). Historical per-turn via #8's endpoint = future extension
- [x] **#6** importance-aware recency boost — **opt-in** (`RAG_RECENCY_WEIGHT`, default 0.0,
  byte-identical); recency scaled by importance so it can't displace older high-importance memories;
  offline sweep 85/85, validate via live-smoke before enabling
- [x] **#19** structured turn errors — additive `errors` (category/stage/message/suggestion) on the
  API/SSE turn responses, derived from the warning strings via `classify_warnings()`; non-breaking
  (warnings preserved, TurnResult unchanged, no 78-site churn). Frontend display = future extension
- [x] **#29** documented why `session_memory_max_episodes` default is 0 (a hard cap regressed
  50-turn recall); no code change

## A tier (quick wins)

- [x] **#24** validate gating strings at stage construction (bad value → ValueError, not silent no-op)
- [x] **#27** CLI color: errors red / warnings yellow / success green (`typer.secho`, auto-strips in tests)
- [~] **#28** ~~extract test-scenarios module~~ — **SKIP (misread)**: `ROSE_GALLERY_MESSAGES`/`STORY_EVENTS`
  are production live-checkpoint data in `app/diagnostics/live_checkpoint.py`, already centralized +
  importable by tests. Moving them would be wrong (not test-only) + pure churn
- [~] **#26** ~~roleplay-aware stopwords~~ — **SKIP**: reverses a documented choice (framing words like
  ask/tell deliberately excluded so "I ask whether she…" doesn't boost unrelated chunks); the stemmer
  splits ask/tell/say variants anyway, so re-including them matches inconsistently. Benefit unprovable
  offline, risk is live-only
- [~] **#18** ~~narrow broad `except Exception`~~ — **SKIP**: the ~20 handlers are intentional
  resilience boundaries (memory/retrieval/critique/diagnostics best-effort degrade-to-warning).
  Narrowing them would let an unexpected type crash a turn — harms robustness for no benefit

## Decisions (2026-07-01 audit)

- **Legacy `/play` UI: deleted.** The Angular SPA at `/app` is the only web UI; `app/web/`,
  its vanilla-JS client/tests, and the `/play` routes were removed in 1.1.0. Rationale: two
  coexisting UIs doubled maintenance and testing surface with no canonical owner.
- **Graduated to 1.1.0.** v1 acceptance passed and the SPA/endpoints shipped since 1.0.0;
  version bumped, `CHANGELOG.md` added, `setup.py`/`setup.cfg` (stale 0.1.0) deleted in favor of
  `pyproject.toml`.
- **Milestone 4 (shared world state): deferred with rationale.** The
  `world_facts`/`WorldFact` layer from the original plan remains unbuilt — deliberately. Durable
  memory + retrieval proved sufficient at 100-turn live scale (recall verified in the extended
  checkpoint, docs/16); first-class mutable world state gets built when live evidence shows
  recall/consistency degrading because facts live only in memory episodes, not before.

## Follow-ups (SPA)

- [ ] SPA session resume: `SessionStore.resume()` exists and is tested; no UI component calls
  it. Wire a resume selector (recent sessions via `GET /sessions`) into the setup picker.

## Not doing (personal-use scope)

StageGraph/DAG/plugin extensibility · hard memory-episode cap default (regressed recall) ·
auth/multi-user/streaming/tracing · corpus-scale micro-opts.

## Side projects

Full tiered list with effort + dependencies: [SIDE_PROJECTS.md](SIDE_PROJECTS.md) — the SPA,
RAG inspector, analytics, and eval dashboard entries shipped in 1.1.0.
Best next: ★ Transcript Exporter (weekend, zero backend).
